# Suppress errors related to not having examples. We do in fact have examples for all profiles, but they are linked to on GitHub rather than as part of the standard IG build process. The reason for this is that the IG publisher build process won't allow us to exclude `Resource.id`, `Resource.meta`, and `Resource.text` in examples. These elements SHOULD NOT be included in resources conforming to our IG, so having examples that include them would be confusing for implementers.
