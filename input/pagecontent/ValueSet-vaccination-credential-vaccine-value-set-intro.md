#### CVX Codes

The CDC provides the [canonical list of valid CVX codes](https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=cvx). **The expansion provided below may be out of date.** In cases where the expansion below differs from the CDC list linked above, implementers should defer to the CDC list.

The CDC also [provides a list of COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/COVID-19-related-codes.html) with "Sale Proprietary Name" (e.g., `Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine`), which MAY be used by Issuers when generating human-readable versions of a vaccination credential.
