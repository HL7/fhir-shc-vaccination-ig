The [code system of CVX codes provided by CDC](https://phinvads.cdc.gov/vads/ViewCodeSystem.action?id=2.16.840.1.113883.12.292) is the canonical list of vaccinations for the purposes of this IG.

The CDC also [provides a list of COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/COVID-19-related-codes.html) with "Sale Proprietary Name" (e.g., `Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine`), which MAY be used by Issuers when generating human-readable versions of a vaccination credential.
